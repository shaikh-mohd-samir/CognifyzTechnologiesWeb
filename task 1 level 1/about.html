    <p>Welcome to the About Page!</p>
    <p>Hi, I’m Mohd Samir ShaikhS — a passionate web developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, functional, and user-friendly digital experiences.
I have hands-on experience with front-end and back-end development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python, and MySQL.

I love solving problems, learning new skills, and building projects that make an impact.
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tools, improving my craft, or brainstorming creative solutions<p>
